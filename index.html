            <p>Kapalka was the designer of Bejeweled (2000),[4][5] PopCap Games' first major hit and an early example of "freemium" casual games.[5] The game was originally known as "Diamond Mine", after a song by the Canadian band Blue Rodeo, but was changed to Bejeweled at Microsoft's insistence.[6] By 2013, variations of Bejeweled had been downloaded over 100 million times.
    
                From 2000 to 2011, Kapalka was the chief game designer at PopCap and worked on many titles including Peggle, Zuma, Alchemy and other popular casual games in the mid 2000s.
                
                With Plants vs. Zombies, Kapalka and the team at PopCap took the risk of hiring designer George Fan away from Blizzard Entertainment for a long development cycle on an offbeat title: as he told Digital Spy, "It's possible where it was a case where it was too weird, too hardcore and too scary for the soccer mums, and where it's too cutesy for hardcore players."[7] The initial release as a PC downloadable for casual players was not successful, but the game later developed a following among Steam players, then Xbox, and then became a major hit on smartphones, paving the way for a variety of sequels and spin-offs.
                
                PopCap sold to Electronic Arts in 2011, and Kapalka left the company in 2014 to pursue a variety of other projects.[8]
